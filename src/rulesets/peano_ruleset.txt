# this ruleset does some peano logic to allow to simplify more stuff
# but mainly its usefull for stresstesting because writing 3 as 3 is cheaper than as (succ(succ(succ 0)))

# bug?: rule (+ P_x 0) -> P_x does not seem to be
# affected by the commutativity rules given.

#commutativity
# (+ P_x P_y) -> (+ P_y P_x)

#peano stuff
(+ (succ P_x) P_y) -> (+ P_x (succ P_y))
(+ (succ P_x) 0) -> (succ P_x)
